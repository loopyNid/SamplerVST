* SIMPLE SAMPLER

a simple sample made with the JUCE framework.

** todo
- [X] mp3 does not work
- [X] volume
- [ ] parameters for DAW
- [ ] panning (https://forum.juce.com/t/how-do-stereo-panning-knobs-work/25773/10)
- [ ] looping
- [ ] ADSR
- [ ] repitch
- [ ] choosing starting/ending sample (https://forum.juce.com/t/sourcesampleposition-in-samplervoice/16399) althought i think for my wanted functionality customizing sampleSound would work.
