* SIMPLE SAMPLER

a simple sample made with the JUCE framework.

** todo
- [ ] volume
- [ ] panning
- [ ] ADSR
- [ ] repitch
- [ ] parameters
- [x] mp3 does not work
- [ ] choosing starting sample (https://forum.juce.com/t/sourcesampleposition-in-samplervoice/16399) althought i think for my wanted functionality customizing sampleSound would work.
